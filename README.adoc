|===
| Command name | Use case
|`grep`| Pattern matching. A classic. Go further than just piping to grep. Be aware of subcommands.
|`sed`| Replacing words and lines and stuff. Printing only pattern matches.
|`awk`| This is OP. Powerful for text processing, basically a swiss army knife for extracting, transformin gand analyzing text but *especially structured data like CSVs or logs*.
|`cut`| Handy little slice and dice command line tool for text processing.
|`tr`| Character level translator.
|`xargs`| Command builder. Stud of a tool. Good for bulk operations.
|`find`|
|`sort`|
|`uniq`| Filters repeated lines in text.
|`tee`|
|`trap`| Essentially a tool for lifecycle hooks.

=== Know the metacharacters
